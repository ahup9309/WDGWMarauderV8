# WDGWMarauderV8

Wardriving firmware for the **Marauder V8 (ESP32-C5)** — with an optional cluster of
five **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C5** nodes that scan in parallel and report back over
ESP-NOW.

It logs Wi-Fi 2.4 + 5 GHz networks and BLE devices with a GPS position, writes them to
microSD in **WigleWifi-1.6** format, and uploads to **[wdgwars.pl](https://ahup9309.github.io)**.

**🇵🇱 Wersja polska: [README.pl.md](README.pl.md)**

This is **not** stock ESP32Marauder. It is separate firmware written for this board.

---

## What it does

**Capture**
- Wi-Fi in promiscuous mode on 2.4 and 5 GHz, with adaptive dwell time per channel
- BLE (active scan), detection of **Flock cameras** over both Wi-Fi and BLE
- **Find My / AirTag** tracker detection and non-owner ring (anti-stalking)
- Capture **without GPS reception** (metro, garage, shopping centre) — hits are parked
  and given a position by interpolation once the fix returns

**Storage and upload**
- microSD, WigleWifi-1.6 with the frequency column
- Double-buffered writer; the card transaction happens **outside the lock**, so capture
  does not drop frames while a write is in flight
- Upload to wdgwars.pl over TLS with a pinned certificate; uploaded files are marked
- Browse logs on the device, upload or delete individual files

**Cluster (optional)**
- The Marauder stops scanning and **coordinates** a fleet of up to 8 nodes
- Channels are split by **measured traffic**, not evenly — a busy channel gets a node to
  itself and stops hopping altogether, hearing every beacon on it
- One node takes the **BLE + Flock** role (the C5 has a single radio — Wi-Fi or BLE,
  never both well)
- The core stamps each hit with the position **from the moment the node heard it**, not
  from the moment it arrived — without that, 20 s of buffering at 50 km/h puts a network
  300 m down the road
- **Over-the-air node updates** from the Marauder's SD card, no cable
- **Pairing with on-screen approval** — every rig generates its own random key

## Hardware

| Role | Board | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Core / standalone wardriver | **Marauder V8 with ESP32-C5** | TFT + touch, microSD, GPS, MAX17048 |
| Cluster node (optional) | **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C5** | 8 MB flash, PSRAM; no display, no card |

The cluster is optional — the Marauder works perfectly well on its own with no nodes
at all.

Power: five nodes in continuous receive draw **~600–750 mA**, plus the Marauder. A USB
hub without its own supply causes resets, and a node browning out looks **exactly** like
a node that lost the core.

---

## Install — browser flasher (easiest)

Needs nothing but a Chrome-based browser.

1. Open **[esptool.spacehuhn.com](https://ahup9309.github.io)**
2. Connect the board over USB, click **Connect**, pick the port
3. Add **one** file at offset **`0x0`**:

| Device | File |
|---|---|
| Marauder V8 | `firmware/marauder-v8-c5/WDGWMarauderV8-marauder-merged.bin` |
| XIAO ESP32-C5 (node) | `firmware/node-xiao-c5/WDGWMarauderV8-node-merged.bin` |

4. Click **Program** and let it finish
5. Power-cycle the board

The merged images contain bootloader, partition table and application, which is why the
offset is `0x0` and there is nothing else to enter.

> **Careful when re-flashing a node over USB.** A node that has ever taken an
> over-the-air update boots from the **second** partition. A merged image writes the
> first one, so without erasing the flash the chip keeps running the **old** firmware —
> even though flashing reports success. Tick **Erase device** before programming.

---

## Install — `esptool` from the command line

Requires `esptool` **5.x**. Version 4.8.1 from Homebrew **hangs on the ESP32-C5** — use
the one bundled with the Arduino ESP32 core, or `pip install --upgrade esptool`.

**Marauder V8:**

```bash
esptool --chip esp32c5 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 921600 write-flash -z \
  0x2000  firmware/marauder-v8-c5/bootloader.bin \
  0x8000  firmware/marauder-v8-c5/partitions.bin \
  0x10000 firmware/marauder-v8-c5/app.bin
```

**XIAO ESP32-C5 node:**

```bash
esptool --chip esp32c5 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 921600 erase-flash
esptool --chip esp32c5 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 921600 write-flash -z \
  0x2000  firmware/node-xiao-c5/bootloader.bin \
  0x8000  firmware/node-xiao-c5/partitions.bin \
  0x10000 firmware/node-xiao-c5/app.bin
```

The `erase-flash` on the node matters — see the partition note above.

Ports: on Linux usually `/dev/ttyUSB0` (Marauder, USB-UART bridge) and `/dev/ttyACM0`
(XIAO, native USB). On macOS `/dev/cu.usbserial-*` and `/dev/cu.usbmodem*`.
Every XIAO enumerates under the **same** port name, so with several of them the port
tells you nothing — read the MAC with `esptool ... read-mac` to know which one you hold.

**Verify a node after flashing** — on reset the console (115200) prints:

```
[node] WDGNODEFW:0004 | firmware v4
```

If that line is missing, the node booted the old image from the other partition.

---

## Configuration

Copy **`wdgwars.cfg.sample`** to the **root of the microSD card** and rename it to
**`wdgwars.cfg`**. The file stays on your card — the firmware never uploads it and never
prints it (passwords are only ever reported as a length).

Minimum to get going:

```ini
ssid=YourWiFiName
pass=YourWiFiPassword
key=your_64_hex_character_api_key
```

Generate the API key in your profile on wdgwars.pl — it is exactly 64 hex characters and
ties uploaded networks to your account, so use your own.

Without the file the device still **captures and logs normally** — only uploading is
unavailable.

---

## Running the cluster

1. Flash the **node** firmware onto each XIAO
2. On the Marauder: **MENU → CLUSTER**
3. Nodes announce themselves. A bar appears:

```
5 node(s) want to join:
1CD4  0178  1BBC  3924  8020
[ ACCEPT ALL ]        * = re-adopt
```

4. Check the address suffixes against your own units, then press **ACCEPT ALL**

The Marauder then generates **its own key** from the hardware RNG and hands it to the
nodes you accepted. From that point the fleet is yours.

**BACK** leaves the screen with the fleet still working. **STOP** ends the session and
closes the log file so it shows up in SYNC.

A star next to an address means "I hold a key but nothing answers me" — that is how a
node asks to be re-adopted after the core was re-keyed. No cable needed.

### Node firmware: first install, then updates

**The first time, every node needs a cable.** There is no way round it: a factory XIAO
has no firmware that could receive an update. Flash each one as described in *Install*
above — browser flasher or `esptool`, either is fine.

**After that, never again.** Updates go over the air from the Marauder's card.

#### Putting the image on the card

Download **`node_fw.bin`** from
[Releases](https://ahup9309.github.io) and copy it to the
**root of the microSD card**:

```
/node_fw.bin          ← here
/wdgwars.cfg
/wdgw/                ← logs live here, the image does NOT
```

The name must be exactly `node_fw.bin` and it must sit in the root, not in `wdgw/`.
That is the only place the firmware looks.

The Marauder checks the card **at every boot**. If it finds an image, the start-up screen
shows a line like `node fw v4 on card`, and the CLUSTER screen adds a note when any node
is behind. You do not have to go looking.

> Prefer not to pull the card? There is a serial route: `nodefw <bytes>` on the console
> (115200), then send the raw file. It takes about two and a half minutes per megabyte and
> **blocks the panel** for the duration — the screen says so. Pulling the card is faster.

#### Running the update

1. **MENU → CLUSTER** — wait for the nodes to check in, then leave with **BACK**
   (not the red STOP, which would release the fleet)
2. **MENU → NODE FW → CHECK** — shows the image version and what each node is running
3. **UPDATE ALL**

What you will see, in order:

| Stage | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `asking nodes who needs it...` | a node listens on the control channel only briefly, so the core waits for each one to speak |
| `sending 42%` | the image is going out by broadcast — five nodes cost the same as one |
| `filling gaps` | broadcasts are unacknowledged, so nodes now request the chunks they missed |
| `updated` per node | written and committed |
| `all 5 now run v4` | **verified after they rebooted** — the version they report back |

**UPDATE ALL is greyed out** when there is nothing to do: no image, no nodes, a transfer
already running, or everything already up to date. Press it anyway and it will say which.

You can leave the screen mid-transfer; the update carries on.

#### Why it will not brick a node

Each node assembles the image in PSRAM and verifies the **SHA-256 of the whole thing**
before flash is touched at all — a partial or corrupted transfer simply fails and the node
keeps running what it had. After committing, the new firmware boots **on probation**:
unless it reaches the core within two minutes it puts the boot partition back and reboots
into the previous version.

That covers the case a hash cannot: an image that is intact but broken.

## The screens

The main screen wardrives. Everything else lives under **MENU**, which has two rows of
options and **INFO | SET | BACK** along the bottom.

### Three screens need another one run first

This trips everyone up once, so it is worth stating before anything else. Three screens
show a **frozen list gathered by a different screen** and deliberately do not gather it
themselves. Open one cold and it looks broken — it is not, it is waiting.

```
   BT SCAN      →  BACK  →   FOX HUNT
   AIRTAG SCAN  →  BACK  →   RING TAG
   CLUSTER      →  BACK  →   NODE FW
```

| You want to | Do this first | Then |
|---|---|---|
| Track down a Bluetooth device | **BT SCAN** — let the list fill | **BACK**, then **FOX HUNT**, pick your target |
| Ring a tracker | **AIRTAG SCAN** — let it find tags | **BACK**, then **RING TAG**, pick the tag |
| Update the nodes | **CLUSTER** — wait for the fleet to check in | **BACK**, then **NODE FW → CHECK → UPDATE ALL** |

**Why they work that way.** Scanning and picking cannot happen at once: the list would
reorder itself under your finger as signals came and went, and on this chip a scan running
behind a picker competes for the one radio. Freezing the list makes the choice stable.

**Leave with BACK, not STOP.** On CLUSTER the red **STOP** ends the session — it releases
the fleet and closes the log file. **BACK** just leaves the screen and everything carries
on, which is what you want before opening NODE FW: it needs the nodes online to see their
versions.

If a picker shows an empty list, it will tell you which screen to run first rather than
sitting on "scanning…" forever.

### SCAN — wardriving

Captures Wi-Fi and BLE with a GPS position and writes WigleWifi-1.6 rows to the card.
Subject to `sub wifi|ble|both` on the console; **both** is the default and the stable one
on this chip.

Underground, in a garage or a shopping centre — anywhere without sky — hits are **parked
rather than discarded**, and given a position by interpolation once the fix returns. A row
at 0,0 would be thrown away by the portal *and* would burn that MAC in the dedup table, so
the network would never be logged again after you drove back out.

### SYNC — logs and upload

Lists the logs on the card, newest first; uploaded ones are marked. Tap a file for
**UPLOAD** and **DELETE** — housekeeping without pulling the card. The file currently
being written is shown as recording and cannot be uploaded.

### BT SCAN — Bluetooth devices

Active BLE scan with a live list: address, name if advertised, RSSI. This is also the
list **FOX HUNT** picks from.

### FOX HUNT — find a specific device

Direction finding by signal strength. Pick a device and walk: the reading rises as you
close in. Useful for locating a beacon, a lost tag, or working out which device in a room
is which.

> **Scan first, then pick.** FOX HUNT deliberately does **not** scan — it shows the list
> **BT SCAN** gathered. Order: **BT SCAN → BACK → FOX HUNT**. Opening it without scanning
> first gives an empty list, which is a prompt, not a fault.

### AIRTAG SCAN — trackers

Finds Find My / AirTag-class trackers around you. Filtering matters here: manufacturer
`0x004C` alone matches **every** Find My participant, phones and Macs included, which
buries the list. The firmware filters on the status-byte category and on service UUIDs —
Apple `0xFD44`, Samsung SmartTag `0xFD5A`, DULT `0xFCB2`, Google, Tile, Chipolo — and
drops anything below −85 dBm, since anti-stalking is about what travels **with** you.

Tags separated from their owner are flagged **SEP**. That flag decides whether ringing
will work.

### RING TAG — make a tracker beep

Pick a tag from what AIRTAG SCAN found and make it sound, to locate something planted in
a bag or a car.

> Same rule: **AIRTAG SCAN → BACK → RING TAG**. The list is frozen from the scan.

**What will and will not ring — this is Apple's design, not a limitation of this
firmware:**

- **Owner ringing** (what the Find My app does) is gated by the pairing secret. Not
  possible from an ESP32, by anyone.
- **Non-owner ringing** (this, the anti-stalking path) works **only while the tag is
  separated from every one of its owner's Apple devices**.

With the owner nearby the write **succeeds at the protocol level** and the tag still stays
silent, answering `0xFFFF`. That is the most misleading symptom in the whole feature:
everything looks like success and nothing beeps.

To ring your own paired tag: switch off Bluetooth on your iPhone and Mac, wait 15–30
minutes until it shows **SEP**, then ring. An AirPods case rings readily and is a red
herring when testing.

### CLUSTER and NODE FW

The fleet and its updates — see the sections above.

### SET and INFO

Settings and device information: firmware build, GPS state, battery, card, memory.

## Security — what it protects, and what it does not

Stated plainly, because published binaries can be searched.

**The fleet key is generated on your device.** It is not in this repository and not in
any image here. It signs every ESP-NOW frame, and control traffic (channel assignments,
core replies) is additionally **encrypted with AES-CCM**.

**What that buys you:** nobody in radio range can push firmware to your nodes or inject
fake networks into your log — which was the serious consequence of the previous,
compiled-in secret.

**What it does not give you:**
- Broadcasts (update chunks, join requests) are **signed but readable** — ESP-NOW cannot
  encrypt a broadcast
- The secret used for **joining only** is public and visible in the image
  (`wdgwars-fleet-2026`). It carries nothing but "may I join?" and grants nothing beyond
  the right to appear on your screen asking to be accepted
- The fleet key crosses the air **in the clear in a single frame**, at the moment you
  press ACCEPT. That window lasts a fraction of a second and your deliberate action opens it
- The tag is a keyed checksum, **not a cryptographic signature**. It stops impersonation
  and accidental cross-talk between fleets, not a determined adversary

**Your data:** `wdgwars.cfg`, with your API key and Wi-Fi passwords, stays on the card.
It is never written to a log, never uploaded, never printed to the console.

## Data format

WigleWifi-1.6 — the one wdgwars.pl expects (**not** 1.4; the difference is the frequency
column):

```
MAC,SSID,AuthMode,FirstSeen,Channel,Frequency,RSSI,Lat,Lon,AltitudeMeters,AccuracyMeters,Type
54:DB:A2:1A:D7:DC,HALNy-2.4G,[WPA2-PSK-CCMP][ESS],2026-07-30 02:41:43,1,2412,-88,50.1234,17.5678,123,8.0,WIFI
82:19:4F:FE:81:43,,[BLE],2026-07-30 02:41:43,0,0,-95,50.1234,17.5678,123,8.0,BLE
```

## When something is wrong

| Symptom | Check first |
|---|---|
| A node "went quiet" | power. Brown-out looks identical to losing the core |
| Node reports an old version after a cable flash | it booted the other partition — erase flash and reflash |
| Counters climbing, card empty | whether a log session is open (the screen names the file) |
| Upload rejected | `202` and `409` from the server are **success**, not errors |
| Writes stop after a while | the card — run `sdtest` on the console |

The serial console (115200) has the full set: `status`, `logstats`, `dumplog`, `cluster`,
`pair`, `nodeota`, `scanstat`, `sdtest`, `help`.

The rule that saved the most time on this project: **a confirmation of a write is not a
confirmation that something works.** Check the effect, not the claim — the version banner
after an update, `logstats` after a write, a read-back from the chip after flashing.
